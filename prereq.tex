\chapter{Prerequisite}
We assume that thereader familiar with the following topics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Set theory
\begin{itemize}
\item Operations on sets: union $A \cup B$, intersection $A \cap B$,  set-theoretic difference $A \backslash B$, disjoint union $A \sqcup B$.
\item Equivalence relations,  equivalence classes, quotient set.
\end{itemize}

\item Calculus
\begin{itemize}
\item Converging sequences.
\item Cauchy sequence.
\item Continuous functions on the real line and in Euclidean space.
\item Open and closed sets in Euclidean space.
\item Compactness of subsets in Euclidean space.
\item Convex functions, Jensen's inequality.
\end{itemize}

\item Geometry
\begin{itemize}
\item Motions of plane and space, conruent figures. 
\item Convexity: definition, convex hull.
\item Convex polyhedra: vertices, faces and edges.
\item Platonic solids: cube, tetrahedron and octahedron.
\item Area and volume.
\end{itemize}

\item Combinatorics
\begin{itemize}
 \item  Basic definitions in graph theory: connectedness, degree of vertex, planar graph.
\end{itemize}

\item Linear algebra
\begin{itemize}
 \item Linear independence 
\end{itemize}



\end{enumerate}
